# Take Two Afterlife — Dev Log

Built for the Epic AI MegaJam 2026 (theme: Director's Cut). Each entry: the prompt, what the agent did, what failed, what was fixed by hand.

## Task 4 — Core scaffold + state machine
- **Prompt:** engine-free C++17 `Core/` with CMake + doctest, root `make test`, match state machine (Lobby → Build → Run → Edit → Premiere → next round or Podium) with rounds/timers from settings JSON.
- **Agent did:** added `Core/` (library + doctest tests), vendored doctest 2.4.11, a small flat-JSON settings parser, the state machine, and the `Makefile`.
- **Failed:** first build — doctest can't print `enum class Phase`; fixed with a `StringMaker<Phase>` in the tests. The sandbox also needed `pip install cmake`.
- **Fixed by hand:** nothing yet.
